Human beings are easily distractable, and computers can be both a tool of good and evil. 

Learning on a computer can be one of your biggest obstacles because you are a human being!

A computer has the entire world at your fingertips: your social media, great television shows, and funny memes! 

### Tips that have helped me with online learning

* Numerous scientific studies over the years have shown that human beings learn better off (1)

#### Turn on all Social Media Blockers ASAP

* The modern computer is a minefield for distraction. Companies make billions a year in grabbing your eyeballs--ban all good social media immediately if you want to do any online learning.
